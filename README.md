Forked from BadBlood which was written by David Rowe and mashed together with kurobeats' Active-Directory-User-Script. The tool creates a Microsoft Active Directory Domain with a structure and objects. The output of the tool aims to recreate domains seen in the real world. After Sparkler creates a domain, users can gain an understanding of the inner workings of Active Directory. Each time this tool creates a domain, it produces different results.

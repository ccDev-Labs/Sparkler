# Sparkler

sparkler bomb

[ˈspɑːklə bɒm]

NOUN
 1. A bottle full of sparkler dust that once lit, is highly unpredictable. 


Forked from [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood) which was written by David Rowe and mashed together with kurobeats' [Active-Directory-User-Script](https://github.com/kurobeats/Active-Directory-User-Script) and WazeHell's [vulnerable-AD](https://github.com/WazeHell/vulnerable-AD). The tool creates a Microsoft Active Directory Domain with a structure and objects. The output of the tool aims to recreate domains seen in the real world (users at least, not sure admins would be this insane...). After Sparkler creates a domain, users can gain an understanding of the inner workings of Active Directory. Each time this tool creates a domain, it produces different results.
